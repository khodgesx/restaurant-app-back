The restaurants are then sorted into two lists - visited or not.

- Be deployed online and accessible to the public via Heroku
- Two git repositories - one for backend and one for frontend 

## Stretch Goals:
- User login/logout feature - saves their lists 
- Pull from a 3rd party API - Cloudinary
- Use a CSS framework like Bootstrap - using Bootstrap for my modals

## Future Goals:
- react router 
- add another model - takeout menus
- clean up design
- Yelp for Restaurant Search
